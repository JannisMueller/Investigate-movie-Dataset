# Investigate-movie-Dataset

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb) including user ratings and revenue.
This data set allows me to investigates which factors have a influence on the sucess of a movie in terms of revenue and rating.

This was my first data analysis project using Jupyter Notebook and Python.

You can find the whole project in the Jupyter Notebook. I also added a html file of the project since it is difficult to see diffs on notebooks and do code reviews


# Installation 
Clone the repository and open the file in Jupyter Notebook
